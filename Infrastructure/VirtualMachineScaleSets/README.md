### Azure VM Scale Set

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) is a compute resource that you can use to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs. With all VMs configured the same, VM scale sets are designed to support true autoscale, and no pre-provisioning of VMs is required. So, it's easier to build large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads.

In the provided Terraform script, a VM Scale Set is being created with the resource block `azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set`. The configuration is not complete, but here's what's being set up:

- `name`: The name of the scale set.
- `location`: The Azure region in which to create the scale set. This is pulling the location from the previously created resource group.
- `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group in which to create the scale set. This is pulling the name from the previously created resource group.

The script is incomplete and needs additional configuration to fully create a VM Scale Set. This would include defining the SKU (which determines the VM size, tier, and capacity), the OS profile (which includes details like the computer name prefix and admin username/password), network profile, and any extensions.

Here's an example of how you might complete the configuration:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set" "example" {
  name                = "example-vmss"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  upgrade_policy_mode = "Manual"

  sku {
    name     = "Standard_F2"
    tier     = "Standard"
    capacity = 3
  }

  os_profile {
    computer_name_prefix = "example"
    admin_username       = "adminuser"
    admin_password       = "P@ssw0rd1234!"
  }

  os_profile_linux_config {
    disable_password_authentication = false
  }

  network_profile {
    name    = "example-network-profile"
    primary = true

    ip_configuration {
      name      = "example-ip-config"
      primary   = true
      subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.example.id
    }
  }

  extension {
    name                 = "DockerExtension"
    publisher            = "Microsoft.Azure.Extensions"
    type                 = "DockerExtension"
    type_handler_version = "1.1"

    settings = <<SETTINGS
    {
      "docker": {
        "compose": {
          "web": {
            "image": "your-docker-image",
            "ports": ["80:80"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    SETTINGS
  }
}
```

Replace `"your-docker-image"` with the name of your Docker image. This script assumes that your Docker image is publicly available. If it's in a private registry, you'll need to configure Docker to authenticate with that registry.
