### Azure VM Scale Set

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) is a compute resource that you can use to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs. With all VMs configured the same, VM scale sets are designed to support true autoscale, and no pre-provisioning of VMs is required. So, it's easier to build large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads.

In the provided Terraform script, a VM Scale Set is being created with the resource block `azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set`. The configuration is not complete, but here's what's being set up:

- `name`: The name of the scale set.
- `location`: The Azure region in which to create the scale set. This is pulling the location from the previously created resource group.
- `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group in which to create the scale set. This is pulling the name from the previously created resource group.

The script is incomplete and needs additional configuration to fully create a VM Scale Set. This would include defining the SKU (which determines the VM size, tier, and capacity), the OS profile (which includes details like the computer name prefix and admin username/password), network profile, and any extensions.

Here's an example of how you might complete the configuration:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set" "example" {
  name                = "example-vmss"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  upgrade_policy_mode = "Manual"

  sku {
    name     = "Standard_F2"
    tier     = "Standard"
    capacity = 3
  }

  os_profile {
    computer_name_prefix = "example"
    admin_username       = "adminuser"
    admin_password       = "P@ssw0rd1234!"
  }

  os_profile_linux_config {
    disable_password_authentication = false
  }

  network_profile {
    name    = "example-network-profile"
    primary = true

    ip_configuration {
      name      = "example-ip-config"
      primary   = true
      subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.example.id
    }
  }

  extension {
    name                 = "DockerExtension"
    publisher            = "Microsoft.Azure.Extensions"
    type                 = "DockerExtension"
    type_handler_version = "1.1"

    settings = <<SETTINGS
    {
      "docker": {
        "compose": {
          "web": {
            "image": "your-docker-image",
            "ports": ["80:80"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    SETTINGS
  }
}
```

Replace `"your-docker-image"` with the name of your Docker image. This script assumes that your Docker image is publicly available. If it's in a private registry, you'll need to configure Docker to authenticate with that registry.

### Configure health probes for my Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set

To configure health probes for your NestJS Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set, you need to create a Load Balancer with a health probe and associate it with the VM Scale Set. The health probe will periodically send requests to the specified endpoint on your application and check the response to determine the health of the application.

Here's an example of how you might modify your Terraform script to add a Load Balancer with a health probe:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_lb" "example" {
  name                = "example-lb"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = "PublicIPAddress"
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.example.id
  }
}

resource "azurerm_lb_probe" "example" {
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  loadbalancer_id     = azurerm_lb.example.id
  name                = "example-probe"
  port                = 3000
  protocol            = "Http"
  request_path        = "/health" # replace with your health check endpoint
}

resource "azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool" "example" {
  loadbalancer_id = azurerm_lb.example.id
  name            = "BackEndAddressPool"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set" "vmss" {
  # ...

  network_profile {
    name    = "${var.vmss_name}-network-profile"
    primary = true

    ip_configuration {
      name      = "${var.vmss_name}-ip-config"
      primary   = true
      subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.subnet.id

      load_balancer_backend_address_pool_ids = [azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.example.id]
    }
  }

  # ...
}
```

In this example, replace `"/health"` with the path to your health check endpoint. The health probe will send HTTP GET requests to this endpoint on port 3000 and expect a 200 OK response.

Please note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it to fit your needs. For example, you might want to configure the health probe to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, or you might want to add a Load Balancer rule to distribute incoming traffic among the VMs in the scale set.


### Configure auto-scaling for Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set

To configure auto-scaling for your NestJS Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set, you can use the `azurerm_autoscale_setting` resource in your Terraform script. 

Here's an example of how you might modify your Terraform script to add auto-scaling:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_autoscale_setting" "example" {
  name                = "example-autoscale"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  target_resource_id  = azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set.vmss.id

  profile {
    name = "AutoScaleProfile"

    capacity {
      default = 1
      minimum = 1
      maximum = 10
    }

    rule {
      metric_trigger {
        metric_name        = "Percentage CPU"
        metric_resource_id = azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set.vmss.id
        time_grain         = "PT1M"
        statistic          = "Average"
        time_window        = "PT5M"
        time_aggregation   = "Average"
        operator           = "GreaterThan"
        threshold          = 75
      }

      scale_action {
        direction = "Increase"
        type      = "ChangeCount"
        value     = "1"
        cooldown  = "PT5M"
      }
    }

    rule {
      metric_trigger {
        metric_name        = "Percentage CPU"
        metric_resource_id = azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set.vmss.id
        time_grain         = "PT1M"
        statistic          = "Average"
        time_window        = "PT5M"
        time_aggregation   = "Average"
        operator           = "LessThan"
        threshold          = 25
      }

      scale_action {
        direction = "Decrease"
        type      = "ChangeCount"
        value     = "1"
        cooldown  = "PT5M"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the VM Scale Set will scale out (add a VM) when the average CPU usage over the last 5 minutes is greater than 75%, and scale in (remove a VM) when the average CPU usage over the last 5 minutes is less than 25%. The minimum number of VMs is 1 and the maximum is 10.

Please note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it to fit your needs. For example, you might want to use a different metric for auto-scaling, or you might want to adjust the thresholds or the scale in/scale out values.

### Configure load balancing for my NestJS Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set

To configure load balancing for your NestJS Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set, you need to create a Load Balancer and associate it with the VM Scale Set. The Load Balancer will distribute incoming traffic among the VMs in the scale set.

Here's an example of how you might modify your Terraform script to add a Load Balancer:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_public_ip" "example" {
  name                = "example-publicip"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  allocation_method   = "Dynamic"
}

resource "azurerm_lb" "example" {
  name                = "example-lb"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = "PublicIPAddress"
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.example.id
  }
}

resource "azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool" "example" {
  loadbalancer_id = azurerm_lb.example.id
  name            = "BackEndAddressPool"
}

resource "azurerm_lb_nat_pool" "example" {
  resource_group_name            = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  name                           = "ssh"
  loadbalancer_id                = azurerm_lb.example.id
  protocol                       = "Tcp"
  frontend_port_start            = 50000
  frontend_port_end              = 50119
  backend_port                   = 22
  frontend_ip_configuration_name = "PublicIPAddress"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set" "vmss" {
  # ...

  network_profile {
    name    = "${var.vmss_name}-network-profile"
    primary = true

    ip_configuration {
      name      = "${var.vmss_name}-ip-config"
      primary   = true
      subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.subnet.id

      load_balancer_backend_address_pool_ids = [azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.example.id]
      load_balancer_inbound_nat_rules_ids    = [azurerm_lb_nat_pool.example.id]
    }
  }

  # ...
}
```

In this example, the Load Balancer has a public IP address and distributes incoming traffic to the VMs in the scale set. The NAT pool allows you to connect to the VMs via SSH on ports 50000-50119.

Please note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it to fit your needs. For example, you might want to add a health probe to the Load Balancer to check the health of your application, or you might want to add Load Balancer rules to control how the traffic is distributed.


### Configure SSL/TLS termination for Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set

To configure SSL/TLS termination for your NestJS Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set, you would typically use an Azure Application Gateway or Azure Load Balancer. 

However, configuring SSL/TLS termination directly in Terraform can be complex because it involves handling SSL certificates, which should be managed securely. 

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take:

1. Create an Azure Key Vault to store your SSL certificate securely.
2. Upload your SSL certificate to the Key Vault.
3. Create an Azure Application Gateway.
4. Configure the Application Gateway to use the SSL certificate from the Key Vault for HTTPS listeners.
5. Configure the backend pools, HTTP settings, and routing rules in the Application Gateway to route traffic to your VM Scale Set.

Here's a basic example of how you might create an Application Gateway with an HTTPS listener in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_application_gateway" "example" {
  name                = "example-appgateway"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  ssl_certificate {
    name     = "example-sslcert"
    data     = filebase64("path-to-your-ssl-cert.pfx")
    password

 =

 "your-ssl-cert-password"
  }

  frontend_port {
    name = "https-port"
    port = 443
  }

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = "frontend-ip"
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.example.id
  }

  backend_address_pool {
    name = "backend-pool"
  }

  backend_http_settings {
    name                  = "http-settings"
    cookie_based_affinity = "Disabled"
    port                  = 80
    protocol              = "Http"
    request_timeout       = 1
  }

  http_listener {
    name                           = "https-listener"
    frontend_ip_configuration_name = "frontend-ip"
    frontend_port_name             = "https-port"
    protocol                       = "Https"
    ssl_certificate_name           = "example-sslcert"
  }

  request_routing_rule {
    name                       = "rule1"
    rule_type                  = "Basic"
    http_listener_name         = "https-listener"
    backend_address_pool_name  = "backend-pool"
    backend_http_settings_name = "http-settings"
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `"path-to-your-ssl-cert.pfx"` with the path to your SSL certificate file and `"your-ssl-cert-password"` with the password for the SSL certificate.

Please note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it to fit your needs. For example, you might want to use the Azure Key Vault to store your SSL certificate securely, or you might want to configure the Application Gateway to use HTTPS for the backend protocol.


### Configure custom domain mapping for Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set


To configure a custom domain for your NestJS Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set, you would typically use Azure DNS or a third-party DNS provider. 

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take:

1. Register a domain name with a domain registrar.
2. Create a DNS zone in Azure DNS for your domain.
3. Create a DNS record that maps your domain to the public IP address of your Load Balancer or Application Gateway.
4. Update the name servers for your domain with your domain registrar to point to the Azure DNS name servers.

Here's a basic example of how you might create a DNS zone and a DNS record in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_dns_zone" "example" {
  name                = "example.com"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_dns_a_record" "example" {
  name                = "www"
  zone_name           = azurerm_dns_zone.example.name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  ttl                 = 300
  records             = [azurerm_public_ip.example.ip_address]
}
```

In this example, replace `"example.com"` with your domain name and `"www"` with the subdomain you want to use (or `@` for the apex domain). The `azurerm_public_ip.example.ip_address` should be the public IP address of your Load Balancer or Application Gateway.

Please note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it to fit your needs. For example, you might want to use a different type of DNS record, or you might want to use a third-party DNS provider instead of Azure DNS.


### Configure SSL/TLS termination for Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set using Azure Application Gateway

To configure SSL/TLS termination for your NestJS Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set using Azure Application Gateway, you would typically use an Azure Key Vault to store your SSL certificate securely. 

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take:

1. Create an Azure Key Vault and upload your SSL certificate to the Key Vault.
2. Create an Azure Application Gateway.
3. Configure the Application Gateway to use the SSL certificate from the Key Vault for HTTPS listeners.
4. Configure the backend pools, HTTP settings, and routing rules in the Application Gateway to route traffic to your VM Scale Set.

Here's a basic example of how you might create an Application Gateway with an HTTPS listener in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_application_gateway" "example" {
  name                = "example-appgateway"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  ssl_certificate {
    name     = "example-sslcert"
    data     = azurerm_key_vault_certificate.example.secret_id
    password = "your-ssl-cert-password"
  }

  frontend_port {
    name = "https-port"
    port = 443
  }

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = "frontend-ip"
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.example.id
  }

  backend_address_pool {
    name = "backend-pool"
  }

  backend_http_settings {
    name                  = "http-settings"
    cookie_based_affinity = "Disabled"
    port                  = 80
    protocol              = "Http"
    request_timeout       = 1
  }

  http_listener {
    name                           = "https-listener"
    frontend_ip_configuration_name = "frontend-ip"
    frontend_port_name             = "https-port"
    protocol                       = "Https"
    ssl_certificate_name           = "example-sslcert"
  }

  request_routing_rule {
    name                       = "rule1"
    rule_type                  = "Basic"
    http_listener_name         = "https-listener"
    backend_address_pool_name  = "backend-pool"
    backend_http_settings_name = "http-settings"
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `"your-ssl-cert-password"` with the password for the SSL certificate. The `azurerm_key_vault_certificate.example.secret_id` should be the ID of the secret in the Key Vault that contains your SSL certificate.

Please note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it to fit your needs. For example, you might want to configure the Application Gateway to use HTTPS for the backend protocol, or you might want to add a health probe to the Application Gateway to check the health of your application.


### Best practices for optimizing the performance of a NestJS Docker application in Azure VM Scale Set

Optimizing the performance of a NestJS Docker application in an Azure VM Scale Set involves several best practices:

1. **Use Azure Load Balancer or Azure Traffic Manager**: These tools can distribute traffic evenly among VMs in your scale set, ensuring that no single VM becomes a bottleneck.

2. **Scale Out**: Increase the number of VM instances in your scale set during peak load times. Azure VM Scale Sets support autoscaling based on metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, or a custom metric.

3. **Use SSD Storage**: SSD storage offers faster disk I/O and can significantly improve the performance of your application.

4. **Optimize Your Application**: Optimize your NestJS application by using techniques like lazy loading, AOT compilation, and compression.

5. **Use Caching**: Use Azure Redis Cache or a similar service to cache frequently accessed data. This can significantly reduce the load on your database and improve your application's response times.

6. **Use CDN**: Use Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static resources closer to users. This can significantly improve load times for users who are geographically distant from your Azure region.

7. **Optimize Docker Images**: Keep your Docker images as small as possible by using multi-stage builds, removing unnecessary files, and using .dockerignore files.

8. **Monitor Performance**: Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to monitor the performance of your application and VM Scale Set. This can help you identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

9. **Use Proximity Placement Groups**: If your application components need to communicate with each other frequently, use Proximity Placement Groups to ensure that your VMs are located close to each other in the same data center.

10. **Optimize Database Performance**: If you're using a database, ensure it's properly indexed and consider using read replicas to distribute read traffic.

Remember, performance optimization is a continuous process and requires regular monitoring and adjustments based on your application's performance metrics.
