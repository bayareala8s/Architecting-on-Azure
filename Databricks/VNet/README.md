### Steps to configure VNET injection with Azure Databricks

Configuring VNET injection with Azure Databricks involves several steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Network (VNet)**: You need to create a VNet in Azure. This VNet will be used to host your Databricks workspace.

2. **Create a Subnet for Databricks**: Within your VNet, create a dedicated subnet for Databricks. This subnet will be used by the Databricks workspace.

3. **Configure Network Security Group (NSG)**: Create an NSG and associate it with your subnet. This NSG will be used to control traffic to and from your Databricks workspace.

4. **Create a Databricks Workspace with VNet Injection**: When creating your Databricks workspace, specify the VNet and subnet that you created in the previous steps. This will inject the Databricks workspace into your VNet.

5. **Configure Databricks Cluster**: After the Databricks workspace is created, you can create a Databricks cluster within the workspace. This cluster will be able to communicate with other resources in your VNet.

Here's an example of how you can do this using Terraform:

```hcl-terraform
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "main" {
  name                = "myVNet"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "private" {
  name                 = "private"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.main.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}

resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "main" {
  name                = "myNSG"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association" "main" {
  subnet_id                 = azurerm_subnet.private.id
  network_security_group_id = azurerm_network_security_group.main.id
}

resource "azurerm_databricks_workspace" "main" {
  name                        = "myDatabricksWorkspace"
  resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  location                    = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  sku                         = "standard"
  managed_resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.main.name}-managed"
  custom_parameters {
    virtual_network_id = azurerm_virtual_network.main.id
    private_subnet_name = azurerm_subnet.private.name
    public_subnet_name = azurerm_subnet.private.name
  }
}
```

In this example, a new VNet named `myVNet` is created with an address space of `10.0.0.0/16`. A subnet named `private` is then created within this VNet with an address prefix of `10.0.1.0/24`. An NSG named `myNSG` is created and associated with the `private` subnet. Finally, a Databricks workspace named `myDatabricksWorkspace` is created and injected into the `private` subnet of `myVNet`.

Please replace the placeholders with your actual values and make sure that the network configurations meet your requirements.


### Limitations of using VNET injection with Azure Databricks


Using VNET injection with Azure Databricks provides several benefits, but it also comes with some limitations:

1. **Complexity**: Implementing VNET injection can add complexity to your Azure Databricks deployment. You need to carefully plan and manage your network settings, which can require a significant amount of time and expertise.

2. **Cost**: VNET injection can increase the cost of your Azure Databricks deployment. For example, you may incur costs for data transfer, especially if your Databricks workspace needs to communicate with resources in other VNets or regions. You also need to consider the costs of the network resources themselves, such as VNets, subnets, and NSGs.

3. **Performance**: The performance of your Databricks workloads can be impacted by your network settings. For example, if your network doesn't have sufficient bandwidth or if there's high latency, this can slow down your workloads.

4. **Maintenance**: VNET injection requires ongoing maintenance. You need to regularly monitor your network to ensure that it's functioning correctly and to detect any potential security issues. You also need to update your network settings as your requirements change.

5. **Limited Support for Certain Azure Services**: Not all Azure services support VNET injection. If you want to use a service that doesn't support VNET injection, you may need to find a workaround or use a different service.

6. **Dependency on Azure Networking**: With VNET injection, your Databricks workspace becomes dependent on Azure networking. If there's an issue with Azure networking, this can impact your Databricks workspace.

7. **Limited to Azure**: VNET injection is specific to Azure. If you want to use a similar feature in a different cloud provider, you may need to find a different solution.

Remember, it's important to carefully consider these limitations when deciding whether to use VNET injection with Azure Databricks.
