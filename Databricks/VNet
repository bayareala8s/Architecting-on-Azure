### Steps to configure VNET injection with Azure Databricks

Configuring VNET injection with Azure Databricks involves several steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Network (VNet)**: You need to create a VNet in Azure. This VNet will be used to host your Databricks workspace.

2. **Create a Subnet for Databricks**: Within your VNet, create a dedicated subnet for Databricks. This subnet will be used by the Databricks workspace.

3. **Configure Network Security Group (NSG)**: Create an NSG and associate it with your subnet. This NSG will be used to control traffic to and from your Databricks workspace.

4. **Create a Databricks Workspace with VNet Injection**: When creating your Databricks workspace, specify the VNet and subnet that you created in the previous steps. This will inject the Databricks workspace into your VNet.

5. **Configure Databricks Cluster**: After the Databricks workspace is created, you can create a Databricks cluster within the workspace. This cluster will be able to communicate with other resources in your VNet.

Here's an example of how you can do this using Terraform:

```hcl-terraform
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "main" {
  name                = "myVNet"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "private" {
  name                 = "private"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.main.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}

resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "main" {
  name                = "myNSG"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association" "main" {
  subnet_id                 = azurerm_subnet.private.id
  network_security_group_id = azurerm_network_security_group.main.id
}

resource "azurerm_databricks_workspace" "main" {
  name                        = "myDatabricksWorkspace"
  resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  location                    = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  sku                         = "standard"
  managed_resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.main.name}-managed"
  custom_parameters {
    virtual_network_id = azurerm_virtual_network.main.id
    private_subnet_name = azurerm_subnet.private.name
    public_subnet_name = azurerm_subnet.private.name
  }
}
```

In this example, a new VNet named `myVNet` is created with an address space of `10.0.0.0/16`. A subnet named `private` is then created within this VNet with an address prefix of `10.0.1.0/24`. An NSG named `myNSG` is created and associated with the `private` subnet. Finally, a Databricks workspace named `myDatabricksWorkspace` is created and injected into the `private` subnet of `myVNet`.

Please replace the placeholders with your actual values and make sure that the network configurations meet your requirements.
