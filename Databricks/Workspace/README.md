### Workspace

A workspace is an environment for accessing all of your Databricks assets. A workspace organizes objects (notebooks, libraries, and experiments) into folders, and provides access to data objects and computational resources.


### Best practices for structuring folders in Azure Databricks workspaces

Structuring folders in Azure Databricks workspaces is crucial for maintaining an organized and efficient workspace. Here are some best practices with a real-world example:

1. **Environment Separation**: Separate your workspaces by environment (e.g., dev, test, prod). This helps to isolate the work and data for each environment and prevents accidental modifications or deletions.

2. **Project-Based Structure**: Organize your notebooks and libraries based on projects or functionalities. This makes it easier to locate and manage related notebooks and libraries.

3. **User Folders**: Create individual folders for each user or team. This allows users or teams to have a dedicated space for their work.

4. **Shared Folder**: Have a shared folder for common notebooks, libraries, or data that are used across multiple projects or by multiple users.

5. **Archiving**: Implement a process for archiving old or unused notebooks and libraries. This helps to keep your workspace clean and organized.

6. **Naming Conventions**: Establish and follow a consistent naming convention for your folders, notebooks, and libraries. This makes it easier to identify the purpose of each item.

7. **Documentation**: Document the purpose and usage of each folder, notebook, and library. This can be done in a README file in each folder or in the description of each notebook or library.

8. **Access Control**: Use access control to manage who can view, edit, or manage each folder, notebook, and library. This helps to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized modifications.

Real-world example:

Let's say you are working on a project called "ProjectX" in a team of 5 developers. You can structure your Azure Databricks workspace as follows:

- `/dev/ProjectX/`: This folder contains all the development notebooks and libraries for ProjectX.
- `/test/ProjectX/`: This folder contains all the test notebooks and libraries for ProjectX.
- `/prod/ProjectX/`: This folder contains all the production notebooks and libraries for ProjectX.
- `/shared/`: This folder contains all the common notebooks, libraries, or data that are used across multiple projects or by multiple users.
- `/users/JohnDoe/`: This folder contains all the notebooks and libraries that are specific to the user John Doe.
- `/users/JaneDoe/`: This folder contains all the notebooks and libraries that are specific to the user Jane Doe.

Each folder should have a README file that documents the purpose and usage of the folder and its contents. Access control should be set up to ensure that only the relevant users can view, edit, or manage each folder, notebook, and library.

Remember, these are general best practices and the optimal structure for your Azure Databricks workspace depends on your specific use case and requirements. Always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
