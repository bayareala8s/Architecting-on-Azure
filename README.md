### Install Azure CLI on macOS

You can install Azure CLI on macOS using the Homebrew package manager. Here are the steps:

1. If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Azure CLI by running:

```bash
brew update
brew install azure-cli
```

3. After the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by checking the version of Azure CLI:

```bash
az --version
```

This should display the version of Azure CLI that you installed.
