### Azure Cloud Big Data Platform Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery, Failover and High Availablity

Azure provides several services and features to ensure business continuity, disaster recovery, failover, and high availability for Big Data platforms. Here are some of them:

1. **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**: ASR is a disaster recovery service that allows you to automate the replication of the virtual machines (VMs) to a secondary location. In the event of a disaster, you can failover to the secondary location, and then fail back to the primary location when it's available again.

2. **Azure Backup**: Azure Backup is a simple and cost-effective backup-as-a-service solution that extends tried-and-trusted tools on-premises with rich and powerful tools in the cloud. It delivers protection for customersâ€™ data no matter where it resides: in the enterprise data center, in remote and branch offices, or in the public cloud.

3. **Geo-Replication**: Azure provides geo-replication features for many of its services. For example, Azure Storage offers geo-redundant storage (GRS) that replicates your data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.

4. **Availability Zones**: Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region. Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. This ensures that if one zone goes down, the other can still function, providing high availability.

5. **Azure Databricks**: Azure Databricks provides reliable and performant Spark clusters which can automatically recover from failures. It also provides features like autoscaling which can help in maintaining high availability.

6. **Azure HDInsight**: Azure HDInsight provides enterprise-grade capabilities such as monitoring, diagnostics, SLA-backed reliability, and security, making it easy for you to focus on your big data workloads without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

7. **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Azure Synapse is an integrated analytics service that accelerates time to insight across data warehouses and big data systems. It provides features like on-demand or provisioned resources, automated pause and resume, and automated backup for reliable and flexible analytics.

Remember, the choice of services and configuration would depend on your specific requirements, including the nature of your workloads, your budget, and your organization's tolerance for downtime.


### Enterprise Data Platform - Patterns and Parctices on Azure

Building an enterprise data platform on Azure involves several patterns and practices. Here are some of them:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Use Azure Data Factory or Azure Databricks for data ingestion. These services can handle both batch and real-time data ingestion.

2. **Data Storage**: Store your data in Azure Data Lake Storage for big data analytics workloads. For structured data that requires transactional capabilities, consider Azure SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB.

3. **Data Processing**: Use Azure Databricks or Azure HDInsight for big data processing. For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workloads, consider Azure Data Factory.

4. **Data Analysis**: Use Azure Synapse Analytics for enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. Azure Databricks can also be used for big data analytics.

5. **Data Visualization**: Use Power BI to create reports and dashboards that visualize your data.

6. **Data Security**: Use Azure Active Directory for identity and access management. Enable encryption at rest and in transit. Use Azure Private Link to securely access Azure services over a private network connection.

7. **Data Governance**: Use Azure Purview to catalog, understand, and manage your data. Implement data retention and archiving policies.

8. **Resiliency**: Use Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup for disaster recovery and backup. Design your architecture to use Azure's availability zones to ensure high availability.

9. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Use Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for monitoring and diagnostics. Use Azure Policy for policy enforcement and compliance.

10. **Cost Management**: Use Azure Cost Management to monitor and control your Azure spending.

Remember, these are general patterns and practices. The specific architecture and services you choose will depend on your specific use cases and requirements.

### Terraform script to create HDInsight kafka cluster with 3 brokers:

Here is a Terraform script that includes the Azure provider, creates a resource group, and then creates an HDInsight Kafka cluster with 3 brokers in the "West US 2" region:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West US 2"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestoracc"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "example" {
  name                  = "example-container"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  container_access_type = "private"
}

resource "azurerm_hdinsight_kafka_cluster" "example" {
  name                = "example-hdicluster"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  cluster_version     = "3.6"
  tier                = "Standard"

  component_version {
    kafka = "2.1"
  }

  gateway {
    enabled  = true
    username = "acctestusrgw"
    password = "Terraf0rm123!"
  }

  storage_account {
    storage_container_id = azurerm_storage_container.example.id
    storage_account_key  = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key
    is_default           = true
  }

  roles {
    head_node {
      vm_size  = "A6"
      username = "acctestusrhn"
      password = "Terraf0rm123!"
    }

    worker_node {
      vm_size               = "A6"
      username              = "acctestusrwn"
      password              = "Terraf0rm123!"
      target_instance_count = 3
    }

    zookeeper_node {
      vm_size  = "A6"
      username = "acctestusrzn"
      password = "Terraf0rm123!"
    }
  }
}
```

Please replace the placeholders with your actual values. For example, replace `"example-resources"` with your desired resource group name, `"example-hdicluster"` with your desired cluster name, `"acctestusrgw"` with your desired gateway username, and `"Terraf0rm123!"` with your desired password. The same goes for the storage account and container names.

This script creates a resource group, a storage account, a storage container, and an HDInsight Kafka cluster with 3 worker nodes (which are the Kafka brokers in this case) in the "West US 2" region.

Please note that you need to have the Azure provider configured and the necessary permissions to create resources in Azure. Also, make sure to install the Terraform AzureRM Provider before running this script.

### Azure Purview

### Azure rtorage data replication types

Azure Storage offers several types of data replication to ensure durability and high availability. Here are the options:

- `LRS` (Locally redundant storage): Makes multiple synchronous copies of your data within a single datacenter.
- `ZRS` (Zone-redundant storage): Stores three copies of your data. It replicates your data across 2 to 3 facilities, either within a single region or across two regions.
- `GRS` (Geo-redundant storage): Replicates your data to a secondary region (hundreds of miles away from the primary location of the source data).
- `RAGRS` (Read-access geo-redundant storage): Same as GRS, but clients can read the data at the secondary location.
