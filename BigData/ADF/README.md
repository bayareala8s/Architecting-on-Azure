### Azure Data Factory (ADF) & key components

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service provided by Microsoft Azure. It enables users to create, schedule, and orchestrate data workflows at scale, facilitating the movement and transformation of data across various sources and destinations. ADF supports both cloud-based and on-premises data sources, providing a unified platform for data integration and management.

Key components of Azure Data Factory include:

1. **Pipeline:** A pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that defines the data workflow within ADF. Activities represent tasks such as data ingestion, transformation, and movement. Pipelines allow users to orchestrate complex data workflows by chaining together multiple activities in a sequence or parallel execution.

2. **Activities:** Activities are the building blocks of ADF pipelines, representing individual tasks or operations performed on data. There are several types of activities available in ADF, including data movement activities (e.g., Copy Data), data transformation activities (e.g., Data Flow), control activities (e.g., Execute Pipeline), and custom activities (e.g., Azure Function).

3. **Datasets:** Datasets define the structure and location of data within ADF. They represent the input and output data sources used by activities within pipelines. A dataset can reference various types of data sources, including Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Storage, on-premises SQL Server, and more.

4. **Linked Services:** Linked services define the connection and authentication settings required to access external data sources and destinations from ADF. Each dataset within ADF is associated with a linked service, which encapsulates the connection information (e.g., connection strings, credentials) for the corresponding data source or destination.

5. **Triggers:** Triggers define the conditions and schedules for executing ADF pipelines. There are different types of triggers available in ADF, including schedule-based triggers, event-based triggers, and manual triggers. Triggers enable users to automate the execution of pipelines based on predefined criteria.

6. **Integration Runtimes:** Integration runtimes provide the compute infrastructure for executing data movement and transformation activities within ADF. There are two types of integration runtimes: Azure Integration Runtime (used for cloud data sources) and Self-hosted Integration Runtime (used for on-premises data sources). Integration runtimes ensure secure and efficient data processing across different environments.

7. **Monitoring & Management:** ADF provides monitoring and management capabilities through Azure Monitor, Azure Data Factory Monitoring, and integration with Azure Data Studio. Users can monitor pipeline executions, track performance metrics, and troubleshoot issues using built-in logging and diagnostic tools.

Overall, Azure Data Factory simplifies the process of data integration and management by providing a scalable and flexible platform for building data pipelines, orchestrating workflows, and transforming data across diverse environments.
