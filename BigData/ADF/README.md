### Azure Data Factory (ADF) & key components

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service provided by Microsoft Azure. It enables users to create, schedule, and orchestrate data workflows at scale, facilitating the movement and transformation of data across various sources and destinations. ADF supports both cloud-based and on-premises data sources, providing a unified platform for data integration and management.

Key components of Azure Data Factory include:

1. **Pipeline:** A pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that defines the data workflow within ADF. Activities represent tasks such as data ingestion, transformation, and movement. Pipelines allow users to orchestrate complex data workflows by chaining together multiple activities in a sequence or parallel execution.

2. **Activities:** Activities are the building blocks of ADF pipelines, representing individual tasks or operations performed on data. There are several types of activities available in ADF, including data movement activities (e.g., Copy Data), data transformation activities (e.g., Data Flow), control activities (e.g., Execute Pipeline), and custom activities (e.g., Azure Function).

3. **Datasets:** Datasets define the structure and location of data within ADF. They represent the input and output data sources used by activities within pipelines. A dataset can reference various types of data sources, including Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Storage, on-premises SQL Server, and more.

4. **Linked Services:** Linked services define the connection and authentication settings required to access external data sources and destinations from ADF. Each dataset within ADF is associated with a linked service, which encapsulates the connection information (e.g., connection strings, credentials) for the corresponding data source or destination.

5. **Triggers:** Triggers define the conditions and schedules for executing ADF pipelines. There are different types of triggers available in ADF, including schedule-based triggers, event-based triggers, and manual triggers. Triggers enable users to automate the execution of pipelines based on predefined criteria.

6. **Integration Runtimes:** Integration runtimes provide the compute infrastructure for executing data movement and transformation activities within ADF. There are two types of integration runtimes: Azure Integration Runtime (used for cloud data sources) and Self-hosted Integration Runtime (used for on-premises data sources). Integration runtimes ensure secure and efficient data processing across different environments.

7. **Monitoring & Management:** ADF provides monitoring and management capabilities through Azure Monitor, Azure Data Factory Monitoring, and integration with Azure Data Studio. Users can monitor pipeline executions, track performance metrics, and troubleshoot issues using built-in logging and diagnostic tools.

Overall, Azure Data Factory simplifies the process of data integration and management by providing a scalable and flexible platform for building data pipelines, orchestrating workflows, and transforming data across diverse environments.

### Handle data ingestion in Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation. Here's a basic step-by-step process on how to handle data ingestion in Azure Data Factory:

1. **Create a Data Factory**: First, you need to create a Data Factory instance in your Azure portal.

2. **Create Linked Services**: Linked services are much like connection strings, which define the connection information needed for Data Factory to connect to external resources. For instance, if you're ingesting data from a blob storage and then storing the transformed data into a SQL database, you would need two linked services - one for the blob storage and one for the SQL database.

3. **Create Datasets**: Datasets are data structures of the data you want to ingest, which point to the data you want to move and transform. They are defined in the Data Factory and they represent data structures within the data stores, which simply point to or reference the data you want to use in your activities as inputs or outputs.

4. **Create Pipelines**: Pipelines are a group of activities. In the case of data ingestion, the activities are mainly Copy activities. A Copy activity in Data Factory copies data from a source data store to a sink data store in a tabular format.

5. **Monitor the Pipeline**: After the pipeline is created, you can monitor the pipeline from the Azure portal. You can view activity run details, set alerts and rerun activities if needed.

Here's a basic example of how to create a pipeline with a Copy activity using Azure Data Factory:

```json
{
    "name": "CopyPipeline",
    "properties": {
        "activities": [
            {
                "name": "CopyActivity",
                "type": "Copy",
                "inputs": [
                    {
                        "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                        "type": "DatasetReference"
                    }
                ],
                "outputs": [
                    {
                        "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                        "type": "DatasetReference"
                    }
                ],
                "typeProperties": {
                    "source": {
                        "type": "BlobSource"
                    },
                    "sink": {
                        "type": "SqlSink"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example, replace `<input dataset name>` with the name of your input dataset (the data you want to ingest), and replace `<output dataset name>` with the name of your output dataset (where you want to store the ingested data). The `source` type is `BlobSource` and the `sink` type is `SqlSink`, which means this pipeline ingests data from a blob storage and stores it into a SQL database.

Please note that this is a very basic example. The actual process of data ingestion can be much more complex depending on the specific requirements of your project.

### Transformation logic in Data Factory

Azure Data Factory primarily focuses on orchestrating and automating data movement and transformation. However, it does not support complex transformations out of the box. For complex transformations, you would typically use Data Factory to orchestrate the movement of data and then call a compute service such as Azure Databricks, Azure HDInsight, or Azure Machine Learning for transformation.

Here's an example of how you can use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate a data transformation process with Azure Databricks:

1. **Create a Databricks Notebook**: First, you need to create a Databricks notebook that contains your transformation logic. For example, you might have a notebook that reads data from a CSV file, performs some transformations, and then writes the transformed data back to a different CSV file.

2. **Create a Databricks Linked Service**: In your Data Factory, create a linked service that connects to your Databricks workspace.

3. **Create a Databricks Dataset**: Create two datasets in your Data Factory, one for the input data and one for the output data. These datasets should point to the locations of your input and output CSV files.

4. **Create a Pipeline with a Databricks Activity**: In your Data Factory, create a pipeline that includes a Databricks activity. This activity should point to the Databricks notebook you created earlier and use the Databricks linked service. The input and output of this activity should be the datasets you created.

Here's an example of how you might define the Databricks activity in your pipeline:

```json
{
    "name": "DatabricksTransformationActivity",
    "type": "HDInsightSpark",
    "linkedServiceName": {
        "referenceName": "<Databricks linked service name>",
        "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
    },
    "typeProperties": {
        "rootPath": "<Databricks notebook path>",
        "entryFilePath": "<Databricks notebook file>",
        "sparkJobLinkedService": {
            "referenceName": "<Azure Blob Storage linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "sparkJobFilePath": "<Path to input CSV file>",
        "sparkJobArgs": [
            "--output",
            "<Path to output CSV file>"
        ]
    },
    "inputs": [
        {
            "referenceName": "<Input dataset name>",
            "type": "DatasetReference"
        }
    ],
    "outputs": [
        {
            "referenceName": "<Output dataset name>",
            "type": "DatasetReference"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, replace `<Databricks linked service name>` with the name of your Databricks linked service, `<Databricks notebook path>` and `<Databricks notebook file>` with the path and file name of your Databricks notebook, `<Azure Blob Storage linked service name>` with the name of your Azure Blob Storage linked service, `<Path to input CSV file>` and `<Path to output CSV file>` with the paths to your input and output CSV files, and `<Input dataset name>` and `<Output dataset name>` with the names of your input and output datasets.

Please note that this is a very basic example. The actual process of data transformation can be much more complex depending on the specific requirements of your project.
