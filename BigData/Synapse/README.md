### Terraform and Bash Script to create Azure Synapse Analytics Pipeline

Creating an Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline involves creating a Synapse workspace and then creating the pipeline itself. Unfortunately, as of now, Terraform does not support creating Synapse pipelines directly. However, you can create a Synapse workspace using Terraform and then use Azure CLI commands in a Bash script to create the pipeline.

Here's how you can create a Synapse workspace using Terraform:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplesa"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_synapse_workspace" "example" {
  name                                 = "example"
  resource_group_name                  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                             = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  storage_data_lake_gen2_filesystem_id = azurerm_storage_data_lake_gen2_filesystem.example.id
  storage_blob_primary_connection_string = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_connection_string
  managed_private_endpoint_enabled     = true
}
```

This script creates a resource group, a storage account, and a Synapse workspace.

To create a Synapse pipeline, you can use Azure CLI commands in a Bash script. However, creating a pipeline involves several steps and requires a JSON definition of the pipeline. Here's a basic example of how you might create a pipeline:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
resourceGroupName="example-resources"
workspaceName="example"
pipelineName="example-pipeline"

# Create pipeline
az synapse pipeline create --workspace-name $workspaceName --name $pipelineName --definition @pipeline.json --resource-group $resourceGroupName
```

In this script, `pipeline.json` should be a JSON file that defines your pipeline. You can create this file using the Synapse Studio.

Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual values. Also, make sure you're logged in to your Azure account (you can do this with `az login`).

A `pipeline.json` file for Azure Synapse Analytics defines the activities and datasets for a pipeline. Here's an example of a simple pipeline that copies data from a blob storage to Azure SQL Database:

```json
{
    "name": "CopyPipeline",
    "properties": {
        "activities": [
            {
                "name": "CopyActivity",
                "type": "Copy",
                "inputs": [
                    {
                        "referenceName": "BlobInput",
                        "type": "DatasetReference"
                    }
                ],
                "outputs": [
                    {
                        "referenceName": "SqlOutput",
                        "type": "DatasetReference"
                    }
                ],
                "typeProperties": {
                    "source": {
                        "type": "BlobSource"
                    },
                    "sink": {
                        "type": "SqlSink"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this pipeline, there's a single activity of type `Copy`. This activity has an input dataset `BlobInput` and an output dataset `SqlOutput`. The source type is `BlobSource` and the sink type is `SqlSink`, which means the data is copied from a blob storage to a SQL database.

The `BlobInput` and `SqlOutput` are references to datasets that should be defined elsewhere in your Synapse workspace. These datasets define the actual data sources and destinations, including the connection strings, file paths, table names, etc.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Real-world pipelines can be much more complex, with multiple activities, control flow structures, parameters, and more.
