### Design, Architect and implement cost monitoring tools for Azure Cloud Services.

Designing, architecting, and implementing cost monitoring tools for Azure Cloud Services involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Design**: The design of the cost monitoring tool should include the ability to track costs by resource, resource group, and subscription. It should also include the ability to set budgets and alerts for cost thresholds.

2. **Architect**: The architecture of the tool should leverage Azure Cost Management APIs to retrieve cost and usage data. It should also use Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions for setting up alerts based on cost thresholds.

3. **Implement**: The implementation of the tool will involve setting up the necessary Azure resources, writing code to interact with the Azure Cost Management APIs, and setting up alerts.

Here's a basic implementation using Azure Functions and Azure Cost Management APIs:

First, you need to create an Azure Function that will be triggered on a schedule (for example, every day at a specific time). This function will call the Azure Cost Management APIs to retrieve cost and usage data.

```python
import os
import requests
from azure.functions import TimerRequest

def main(mytimer: TimerRequest) -> None:
    api_version = '2019-11-01'
    scope = f'/subscriptions/{os.environ["SUBSCRIPTION_ID"]}'
    url = f'https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/Query?api-version={api_version}'

    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }

    payload = {
        'type': 'ActualCost',
        'timeframe': 'MonthToDate',
        'dataset': {
            'granularity': 'Daily',
            'aggregation': {
                'totalCost': {
                    'name': 'Cost',
                    'function': 'Sum'
                }
            }
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    cost_data = response.json()

    # Process the cost data as needed
    process_cost_data(cost_data)

def process_cost_data(cost_data):
    # Implement your cost data processing logic here
    pass
```

In this code, replace `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your Azure subscription ID and access token respectively. The `process_cost_data` function is where you would implement your logic for processing the cost data, such as sending an email if the cost exceeds a certain threshold.

Please note that this is a basic example and a real-world implementation would likely involve more complex processing of the cost data, error handling, and security considerations.

### Best practices for implementing cost monitoring tools in Azure Cloud Services

Implementing cost monitoring tools in Azure Cloud Services involves several best practices:

1. **Use Azure Cost Management and Billing**: Azure Cost Management and Billing is a native Azure service that provides tools for monitoring, allocating, and optimizing your Azure costs. It provides cost analysis, budgets, cost alerts, and exports.

2. **Tagging Resources**: Tagging Azure resources is a powerful way to categorize and track costs. You can apply tags to resources, resource groups, and subscriptions, then filter and group costs by these tags in cost analysis.

3. **Set Budgets and Alerts**: Setting budgets for your expected costs and creating alerts that notify you when your costs exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budget is a good practice to avoid unexpected charges.

4. **Use Management Groups**: If you have multiple subscriptions, you can organize them into containers called management groups. This allows you to manage your costs at a higher level than individual subscriptions.

5. **Regularly Review and Analyze Costs**: Regularly reviewing and analyzing your costs can help you understand your spending patterns and identify areas where you can reduce costs.

6. **Optimize Resource Usage**: Continuously monitor the usage of your resources and turn off or scale down the ones that are underutilized. You can use Azure Advisor for personalized recommendations to optimize your resources for high availability, security, performance, and cost.

7. **Use Reserved Instances and Savings Plans**: If you have predictable, steady-state workloads, purchasing Reserved Instances or Savings Plans can lead to significant cost savings over pay-as-you-go pricing.

8. **Monitor Unused Resources**: Regularly check for and remove unused resources. This includes unattached disk volumes, old snapshots, and unused virtual machines.

9. **Automate Cost Management Tasks**: Use Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions to automate tasks such as sending cost reports, setting budgets, and creating alerts.

10. **Implement Governance Policies**: Use Azure Policy to implement governance policies that can help control your costs. For example, you can create policies to restrict the creation of high-cost resources or to require tags on all resources.

Remember, the specific practices you choose will depend on your specific use cases and requirements.


### Monitor Unused Resources in Azure

Monitoring unused resources in Azure can be achieved by using Azure Advisor, a personalized cloud consultant that helps you follow best practices to optimize your Azure deployments. It analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry and then recommends solutions that can help you improve the cost effectiveness, performance, high availability, and security of your Azure resources.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Azure Advisor to monitor unused resources:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Advisor".

3. In the Advisor dashboard, you'll see several tabs for different types of recommendations: High Availability, Security, Performance, and Cost.

4. Click on the "Cost" tab. This tab shows cost recommendations that can help you optimize and save on your Azure resources.

5. Look for recommendations titled "Delete or reconfigure idle virtual machines" or "Delete unused disk volumes". These recommendations identify unused resources that you might want to delete to save costs.

6. Click on a recommendation to see more details about the unused resources and to take action.

Please note that Azure Advisor's recommendations are based on analyzing your usage patterns over a period of time, so it might not immediately identify newly created resources as unused.

Also, before deleting any resources, make sure to verify that they are indeed unused and not needed for any future tasks.


### Azure Advisor

Azure Advisor is a personalized cloud consultant that helps you optimize your Azure deployments. It analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry and then recommends solutions that can help you improve the cost effectiveness, performance, high availability, and security of your Azure resources.

Azure Advisor provides recommendations in four categories:

1. **Cost**: These recommendations can help you eliminate unprovisioned Azure resources and optimize your Azure resource usage to save money.

2. **Performance**: These recommendations can help you improve the speed and responsiveness of your applications running on Azure.

3. **High Availability**: These recommendations can help you improve the continuity of your applications by ensuring that they are highly available.

4. **Security**: These recommendations can help you discover and fix potential security vulnerabilities.

You can access Azure Advisor through the Azure portal. Once you're in the portal, you can see the Advisor dashboard by searching for 'Advisor' in the search bar. The dashboard will show you all the recommendations for your resources. You can choose to implement the recommendations, postpone them for a certain period, or dismiss them if they're not relevant to you.
