### Design, Architect and implement cost monitoring tools for Azure Cloud Services.

Designing, architecting, and implementing cost monitoring tools for Azure Cloud Services involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Design**: The design of the cost monitoring tool should include the ability to track costs by resource, resource group, and subscription. It should also include the ability to set budgets and alerts for cost thresholds.

2. **Architect**: The architecture of the tool should leverage Azure Cost Management APIs to retrieve cost and usage data. It should also use Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions for setting up alerts based on cost thresholds.

3. **Implement**: The implementation of the tool will involve setting up the necessary Azure resources, writing code to interact with the Azure Cost Management APIs, and setting up alerts.

Here's a basic implementation using Azure Functions and Azure Cost Management APIs:

First, you need to create an Azure Function that will be triggered on a schedule (for example, every day at a specific time). This function will call the Azure Cost Management APIs to retrieve cost and usage data.

```python
import os
import requests
from azure.functions import TimerRequest

def main(mytimer: TimerRequest) -> None:
    api_version = '2019-11-01'
    scope = f'/subscriptions/{os.environ["SUBSCRIPTION_ID"]}'
    url = f'https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/Query?api-version={api_version}'

    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }

    payload = {
        'type': 'ActualCost',
        'timeframe': 'MonthToDate',
        'dataset': {
            'granularity': 'Daily',
            'aggregation': {
                'totalCost': {
                    'name': 'Cost',
                    'function': 'Sum'
                }
            }
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    cost_data = response.json()

    # Process the cost data as needed
    process_cost_data(cost_data)

def process_cost_data(cost_data):
    # Implement your cost data processing logic here
    pass
```

In this code, replace `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your Azure subscription ID and access token respectively. The `process_cost_data` function is where you would implement your logic for processing the cost data, such as sending an email if the cost exceeds a certain threshold.

Please note that this is a basic example and a real-world implementation would likely involve more complex processing of the cost data, error handling, and security considerations.
