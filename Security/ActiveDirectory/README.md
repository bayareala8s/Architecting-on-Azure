### Azure Active Directory Built-In roles

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides several built-in roles for managing resources in your organization. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. **Global Administrator**: Has access to all administrative features in Azure AD. The person who signs up for the Azure AD subscription becomes a Global Administrator.

2. **User Administrator**: Can manage all aspects of users and groups, including resetting passwords for limited admins.

3. **Billing Administrator**: Makes purchases, manages subscriptions, manages support tickets, and monitors service health.

4. **Password Administrator**: Can reset passwords, manage service requests, and monitor service health. Password administrators can reset passwords only for users and other password administrators.

5. **Security Administrator**: Manages security features in Azure AD and configures security settings.

6. **Exchange Administrator**: Manages mailboxes in Exchange Online and performs tasks such as setting email properties for users.

7. **SharePoint Administrator**: Manages SharePoint Online and performs tasks such as setting SharePoint properties for users.

8. **Teams Administrator**: Manages settings for Teams in your organization.

9. **Conditional Access Administrator**: Manages and creates conditional access policies.

10. **Security Reader**: Can read security information and reports in Azure AD.

Remember, these are just a few examples. Azure AD provides many more built-in roles, and you can also create custom roles if the built-in roles do not meet your needs. Always assign the least privilege necessary to perform a task to follow best security practices.
